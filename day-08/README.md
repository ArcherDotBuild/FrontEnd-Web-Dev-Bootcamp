#### 1. grid

CSS Grid is a layout system that arranges elements in rows and columns, providing control over sizing, positioning, and alignment of items within a two-dimensional grid structure.

##### CSS Grid VS Flexbox

CSS Grid is best for creating two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns), while Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts (either row or column). Grid offers more control over both axes, while Flexbox focuses on content alignment along a single axis. Flexbox is more suited for smaller components within a layout, and Grid is better for the overall structure.
