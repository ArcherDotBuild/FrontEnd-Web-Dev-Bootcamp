## Let's break down what each part of this code does in detail

focusing on the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I'll explain the theory and practice of each, and then provide the commented code for better understanding.

### Explanation Summary

- **HTML:** Sets up radio buttons for the user to select different grid column sizes and creates the grid layout that will change based on the selection.
- **CSS:** Uses a CSS variable (`--col-track-size`) to control the grid column sizes dynamically and applies basic styling to make the grid look clean and structured.
- **JavaScript:** Listens for changes to the radio buttons and updates the CSS variable accordingly, which in turn changes the appearance of the grid in real-time.

This approach allows the grid's columns to be adjusted dynamically without needing to reload the page or manually change the CSS code.

### HTML Explanation

This HTML file creates a simple web page with two main sections:

1. **Option Container**: Contains a set of radio buttons that allow the user to select different layout options for a CSS grid.
2. **Grid Container**: Displays a grid with three items, which will adjust based on the user's selection of the radio buttons.

The radio buttons have specific values like `auto`, `min-content`, `max-content`, and `fit-content(10em)` that will be used to control the size of the grid columns.

#### Key Points:

- The **radio buttons** are used to let the user select how the grid should behave.
- The grid items are wrapped in a div with the class `container`.

### CSS Explanation

The CSS code styles the grid container and the radio button options. It uses a CSS custom property (`--col-track-size`) to dynamically control the width of the grid columns.

1. **Grid Container (`.container`)**:

- It uses `display: grid` to create a grid layout.
- The `grid-template-columns` property sets the column size using the CSS variable `--col-track-size`.
- The value of this CSS variable is set to `auto` by default, but can be changed based on the user input (radio button selection).
- Other properties, like `gap`, `width`, `border`, and `padding`, define the spacing and appearance of the grid.

2. **Option Container (`.option-container`)**:

- Uses a grid layout to display the radio buttons in four columns.

### JavaScript Explanation

The JavaScript code is responsible for dynamically updating the CSS variable (`--col-track-size`) based on the selected radio button. This means that the grid's column sizes will change when a different radio button is selected.

1. **DOMContentLoaded Event Listener:**

- Ensures that the script runs only after the HTML document has fully loaded.

2. **Radio Button Event Listener:**

- Adds a `change` event listener to each radio button.
- When a user selects a different radio button, the JavaScript code updates the `--col-track-size` property to reflect the new value.

The practical effect of this is that the grid layout changes in real-time according to the user's selection.

## Explanation of Value Changes in JavaScript Code

### How the Values Change When You Click on an Input

The values that are used to update the CSS variable (`--col-track-size`) are actually coming directly from the `value` attribute of each radio button in the HTML. This attribute determines the value that gets applied when a radio button is selected.

Here's how it works step by step:

1. **HTML Structure and Value Attributes:** Each radio button has a `value` attribute defined in the HTML:

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

```html
<input type="radio" name="track-width" id="auto" value="auto" checked />
<input type="radio" name="track-width" id="min-content" value="min-content" />
<input type="radio" name="track-width" id="max-content" value="max-content" />
<input
  type="radio"
  name="track-width"
  id="fit-content"
  value="fit-content(10em)"
/>
```

The values for each radio button are:

- **auto**
- **min-content**
- **max-content**
- **fit-content(10em)**

2. **JavaScript Code Handling:** When you click on one of these radio buttons, the JavaScript code captures this event and reads the `value` attribute of the clicked radio button using the following line:

```javascript
e.target.value
```

Here, `e.target` refers to the radio button that was clicked, and `e.target.value` retrieves the value of that radio button.

3. **Updating the CSS Variable:** The value that is retrieved (`auto`, `min-content`, `max-content`, or `fit-content(10em)`) is then used to update the CSS variable `--col-track-size` in the following line:

```javascript
document
  .querySelector('.container')
  .style.setProperty('--col-track-size', e.target.value)
```

This updates the grid's column sizes dynamically, based on which radio button is selected.

#### Why It Changes When You Click an Input

The reason why the grid changes its appearance when you click a radio button is because of this process:

- The radio button has a predefined `value` attribute in the HTML.
- hen clicked, the JavaScript captures this value and assigns it to the CSS variable - (`--col-track-size`).
  The CSS grid layout (`grid-template-columns`) uses this variable to define the size of each column, so the appearance of the grid changes accordingly.
  In summary: The values come directly from the HTML attributes of the radio buttons (`value="auto"`, `value="min-content"`, etc.). The JavaScript code then reads these values and updates the CSS variable to make the changes visible on the grid.
