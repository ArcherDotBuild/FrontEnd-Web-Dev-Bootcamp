### Roadmap

- 1: npm (Node Package Manager)
- 2: semantic versioning
- 3: Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

#### 1. npm (Node Package Manager)

npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool for managing JavaScript packages. It helps developers install, update, and manage libraries and dependencies in their projects. Often used with Node.js, npm simplifies sharing and reusing code, making it easier to set up and maintain JavaScript applications.

- `node -v`
- `npm -v`
- `npm init -y` first step, creates the package.json
- `npm i sass` install's sass package in the current folder
- `npm -g` install's a package globally
- `npm update lodash` updates the lodash package
- `npm i lodash@4.0.0` install's an specific lodash version
- `npm uninstall lodash` uninstall the lodash package
- `npm remove lodash` uninstall the lodash package
- `npm i -D lodash` install's as a development dependency
- `npm view sass versions` shows all sass versions

#### 2. semantic versioning

1.55.0

(1) - major version

- new features
- not backward compatible; this will break existing funcionality

(55) - minor version

- small updates to the package
- generally backward compatible

(0) - patch

- small bug fixes
- backward compatible

#### 3. Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and functions, making CSS more flexible and easier to maintain. It compiles into regular CSS, enhancing styling capabilities in web development.
