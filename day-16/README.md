#### 1. npm (Node Package Manager)

npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool for managing JavaScript packages. It helps developers install, update, and manage libraries and dependencies in their projects. Often used with Node.js, npm simplifies sharing and reusing code, making it easier to set up and maintain JavaScript applications.
