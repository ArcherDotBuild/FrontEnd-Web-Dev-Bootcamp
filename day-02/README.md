#### 1. Homework

#### 2. Live Server Install and run

- Search for Live Server Extension in VSCode, install it, test it and run it

#### 3. CSS syntax

- In CSS the order in which you define rules take precedence
- In CSS the type of rule takes precedence over the other, id > general rule

#### 4. Box Model

- Padding and Margin has 4 edges values, top, right, bottom, left `padding: 12px 12px 12px 12px`
- Shorthand property for top, bottom with 1 value and right, left with 1 value `padding: 12px 12px`
- Padding is the space between the border and the content
- Margin is the space between the border and the other elements

#### 5. Units

- display: block, takes all the space
- display: inline, takes only the space that it requires
