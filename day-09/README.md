#### 1. grid

#### 1. grid areas

The `grid-template-areas` property in CSS is used to define a grid layout in a more visual way by assigning names to specific areas of the grid. This makes it easier to position elements within the grid by referencing these named areas, rather than specifying exact row and column positions.

Here's how it works:

- You create a grid with named areas, which are defined as strings. Each string represents a row in the grid, and each word in that string represents a grid cell.
- You use these names to place your grid items into the corresponding areas.
